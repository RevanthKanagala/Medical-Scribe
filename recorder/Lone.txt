The wolf on the hill is never as hungry as the wolf climbing the hill. It's not easy going it alone. But if you keep going, stay true to yourself. It will be worth it in the end. The hardest walk you can make is the walk you make alone. But that. That is the walk that makes you the strongest. That is the walk that builds your character the most. To all of you fighting battles alone. To all of you, going against the grain, battling the naysayers. Stay strong. Keep going. Stay strong. Keep going. This walk is hard. But the hardest walks lead to the greatest destinations. The toughest climbs always lead to the best views. It will be worth it in the end. And if you show what you are made of, the right people will show up in your life. You won't be a lone wolf forever. You have qualities only few can admire because most don't possess. You have strength only few can understand because most have never experienced. So don't give in. Don't settle. Don't lower your expectations to fit into the world. You were born to stand out. You were born to lead. Lead back. They say the wolf on the hill is never as hungry as the wolf climbing the hill. Always be that wolf climbing the hill. Always hungry for more. Always hungry to grow. Always to feed your mind and rise to the highest level you can take yourself. Never looking back. Always looking forward to the next feast. Feast of success in whatever you do. It does not matter if you have to walk alone for a while. It is much better to walk alone in the right direction than to follow the herd walking in the wrong direction. Stay strong. Be different. Your destiny is in your hands. Get out there and hunt it. RA Fearless Motivation Download or stream to any device worldwide fearlessmotivation. Com.
